OpenTok.js Stream Filter Sample
=======================

As of v2.13 of opentok.js you can pass a custom videoSource and custom audioSource to the Publisher. This sample shows how to use this API to apply custom filters to a Publisher. It is very similar to the Basic Video Chat example but it adds a [publish.js](./js/publish.js) and [filters.js](./js/filters.js) files which handle publishing a custom videoSource and audioSource.
