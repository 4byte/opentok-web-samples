OpenTok.js Stream Filter Sample
=======================

As of v2.13 of opentok.js you can pass a custom videoSource and custom audioSource to the Publisher. This sample shows how to use this API to apply custom filters to a Publisher. It is very similar to the [Basic Video Chat](../Basic%20Video%20Chat/) example but it adds a [publish.js](./js/publish.js) and [filters.js](./js/filters.js) files which handle publishing a custom videoSource and audioSource.

## Running the App

Follow the instructions at [Basic Video Chat](../Basic%20Video%20Chat/)

## Browser Support

The custom streaming API works on Chrome 51+, Firefox 49+ and Safari 11+.
